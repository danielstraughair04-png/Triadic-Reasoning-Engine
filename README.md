Triadic Agent v7.0 is a domain-general mechanistic reasoning engine that decomposes any scientific process into three strictly separated layers. The NEGATIVE state contains the initial physical components, particles, fields, and measurable conditions that exist before any interaction occurs. The NEUTRAL state consists purely of causal interactions between NEG items and avoids outcomes, teleology, or future consequences. The POSITIVE state describes stable physical conditions that exist after the interactions and avoids action verbs or process language. This disciplined separation is based on the Triadic Framework, created by Daniel Straughair, which improves clarity, interpretability, and causal structure by isolating components, interactions, and realized outcomes into distinct layers.

Triadic Agent v7.0 applies this structure consistently across all scientific domains. It has demonstrated robust cross-domain stability and clarity in fields such as astrophysics, quantum mechanics, biochemistry, electrical engineering, neuroscience, classical mechanics, and thermodynamics. Because each output uses the same NEG–NEU–POS pattern, the system serves as a universal representation of mechanistic reasoning that is interpretable, teachable, and deeply structured.

The system uses a multi-model pipeline. A physically grounded explanation is produced first and sanitized for clarity. A second model extracts NEGATIVE components using strict filtering rules that eliminate abstract nouns, actions, outcomes, and nonphysical concepts. A new NEUTRAL list is generated by prompting a model for causal mechanisms that reference at least two NEG items. Finally, the POSITIVE list is generated by transforming each mechanism into a completed, stable physical condition. A diagnostics module checks structural alignment and ensures that each layer remains logically consistent. This design transforms language models from storytellers into mechanistic analyzers.

Triadic Agent yields several desirable properties. It is deterministic in structure, producing consistent causal chains across different model runs. It is causally interpretable because each step is grounded in strictly physical reasoning. It is universal, functioning across a broad range of scientific topics without modification. It is composable because POSITIVE states can become NEGATIVE states for a nested triad. It is transparent due to the diagnostics system, which flags extraction or alignment issues. These properties make the framework suitable for education, research, interpretability work, and early-stage discovery.

Triadic Agent v7.0 has been tested on a variety of complex processes including Hawking radiation, nuclear fusion, catalysis, protein folding, neuron signaling, electromagnetic induction, semiconductors, and rectification. In each case, the system accurately identifies relevant initial components, correctly maps physical interactions, and produces stable realized states. This demonstrates its domain-independence and potential as a general mechanistic reasoning engine.

To install and run Triadic Agent v7.0, ensure you have Python 3.9 or later. Install the necessary dependencies by running:
pip install requests python-dotenv
In the project directory, create a file named .env and add your OpenRouter API key as:
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
The repository should include the main script (triadic_agent.py) and an examples folder containing demonstration outputs. To run the engine, execute:
python triadic_agent.py
Inside the script, modify the topic variable to analyze any scientific process. The agent will print a sanitized explanation, the NEGATIVE state, the NEUTRAL state, the POSITIVE state, and diagnostics.

The NEGATIVE state lists only physical entities that exist before any interaction. The NEUTRAL state describes causal interactions between those entities and always references at least two NEG items. The POSITIVE state converts each interaction into a stable, static condition using phrasing like “is present”, “is established”, or “is formed.” This three-layer decomposition creates a clear, interpretable mechanistic chain. If further detail is needed, any NEUTRAL mechanism can be “zoomed in” by using it as a new topic to generate a nested triad with finer resolution.

Triadic Agent is designed for scientific explanation, reasoning transparency, educational visualization, hypothesis refinement, and cross-domain mechanistic modeling. It provides a structured, deterministic alternative to narrative-style LLM outputs and allows users to inspect scientific processes as state-based transformations. This makes it suitable for students, researchers, educators, and engineers who require clear mechanistic descriptions rather than storytelling.

Below is a minimal Python example demonstrating programmatic use:

from triadic_agent import TriadicAgent
agent = TriadicAgent()
topic = "How catalysts speed up reactions"
result = agent.run(topic)
print(result.explanation)
print(result.negative)
print(result.neutral)
print(result.positive)
print(result.diagnostics)

Future directions for the project include building a graphical interface where NEUTRAL mechanisms are clickable and open into nested triads, developing a mechanistic graph engine for storing and comparing triads, designing an educational interface for classroom use, and integrating simulation data to validate mechanistic structures. The Triadic Framework may also support automated discovery workflows by identifying missing mechanisms or inconsistencies in existing scientific explanations.

Triadic Agent v7.0 represents an early but functional demonstration that LLMs can be guided into stable mechanistic reasoning through structured prompts, rule-based filtering, and strict causal decomposition. This repository provides both the engine and multiple cross-domain examples to facilitate adoption, experimentation, and continued development.

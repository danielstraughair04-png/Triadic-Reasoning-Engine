# Triadic-Reasoning-Engine
A universal NEG–NEU–POS mechanistic reasoning engine that decomposes any scientific process into structured causal states. Powered by the Triadic Framework and LLMs via OpenRouter.


Triadic Agent v7.0 is a domain-general mechanistic reasoning engine that decomposes any scientific process into three strictly separated layers:

NEGATIVE — Initial States
Physical components, particles, fields, energies, and measurable conditions that exist before any interaction occurs.
NEUTRAL — Mechanisms
Pure causal interactions between NEG states. No outcomes, no teleology, no future consequences.

POSITIVE — Realized States
Stable physical conditions that exist after the neutral mechanisms. No actions, no processes, no causal verbs.

This structure is based on the Triadic Framework, created by Daniel Straughair, which provides clarity and consistency by separating structure, interaction, and resulting conditions.
Key Features
Domain-universal: works across physics, engineering, chemistry, biology, astrophysics, and more
Produces step-by-step causal mechanisms
Enforces strict NEG/NEU/POS separation

Supports recursive "nested triads" for deeper mechanistic explanations

Clean, interpretable output ideal for teaching and research
Powered by OpenRouter and LLMs with strong physical reasoning ability

How It Works
Triadic Agent v7.0 enforces:

NEGATIVE (Initial States): Components, particles, fields, energies, structural properties. No actions or processes.
NEUTRAL (Mechanisms): One causal interaction per line. Must reference two or more NEG items. No outcomes or teleological language.
POSITIVE (Realized States): Stable physical conditions that follow the mechanisms. Uses phrases like "is present", "is established", "is formed", "is maintained". No verbs describing actions or processes.

This structure applies universally across scientific domains.

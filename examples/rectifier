===== TRIADIC AGENT v7.0 =====
TOPIC: How AC becomes DC through rectification.

EXPLANATION:
Diodes allow current only during forward bias. Negative cycles are blocked or redirected. Resulting output is unidirectional but pulsating. Load resistor receives DC.

NEGATIVE — INITIAL STATES:
  voltage
  diodes
  electrical current
  electrons
  load resistor
  direct current (dc)
  pulsating output voltage

NEUTRAL — INTERACTIONS:
  Voltage across a diode regulates current flow.
  Diodes restrict electron movement to one direction.
  Current passing through load creates a voltage drop.
  DC flows through forward-biased diode above threshold.
  Load resistor dissipates energy from current.
  Electrons accumulate at junction under reverse bias.
  Pulsating voltage arises from rectifying AC.
  Voltage across load varies with current.

POSITIVE — REALIZED STATES:
  Regulated current flow is established.
  Unidirectional electron movement is present.
  Voltage drop across load is formed.
  Forward voltage bias is established.
  Energy dissipation is present in load resistor.
  Electron accumulation at junction is present.
  Pulsating DC output is established.
  Variable load voltage is present.

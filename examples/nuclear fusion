===== TRIADIC AGENT v7.0 =====
TOPIC: How nuclear fusion occurs in stars.

EXPLANATION:
Gravitational forces compress the star's core, increasing temperature and pressure. High kinetic energy from thermal motion overcomes electrostatic repulsion between hydrogen nuclei, allowing close approach. The strong nuclear force binds protons into deuterium via weak interaction. Subsequent collisions produce helium-3 and helium-4. Mass-energy conversion releases gamma photons that transfer energy through the plasma.

NEGATIVE — INITIAL STATES:
  gravitational forces
  core
  temperature
  pressure
  kinetic energy
  hydrogen nuclei
  strong nuclear force
  deuterium
  helium-3
  helium-4

NEUTRAL — INTERACTIONS:
  Gravitational forces acting on the core generate increased pressure.
  High temperature elevates kinetic energy of hydrogen nuclei.
  Pressure compresses hydrogen nuclei and deuterium.
  The strong nuclear force attracts hydrogen nuclei to deuterium at minimal distances.
  Temperature fluctuations alter kinetic energy levels in helium nuclei.
  Pressure conditions regulate motion of helium-4 relative to hydrogen nuclei.
  Kinetic energy modulates interactions with helium-3 via the strong force.

POSITIVE — REALIZED STATES:
  Increased pressure is established in the core.
  Elevated kinetic energy of hydrogen nuclei is present.
  A region of compressed hydrogen nuclei and deuterium is formed.
  Attraction between nuclei is maintained.
  Altered kinetic energy levels in helium nuclei are present.
  Regulated motion of helium-4 relative to hydrogen nuclei is established.
  Stabilized interaction between hydrogen nuclei and helium-3 is present.

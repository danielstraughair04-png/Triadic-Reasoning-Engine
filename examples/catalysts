TOPIC: How catalysts speed up reactions.

EXPLANATION:
Reactant molecules adsorb onto catalyst active sites. Electron redistribution and bond weakening lower activation energy. Transition states form more easily. Products desorb, and the catalyst remains unchanged.

NEGATIVE — INITIAL STATES:
  reactant molecules
  catalyst surface
  catalyst atoms
  electrons
  active sites
  chemical bonds
  kinetic energy
  transition state

NEUTRAL — INTERACTIONS:
  Reactant molecules collide with active sites.
  Electrons transfer between catalyst atoms and reactant bonds.
  Kinetic energy transfers to chemical bonds.
  Catalyst atoms interact at active sites.
  Chemical bonds stretch approaching the transition state.
  Reactant molecules adsorb onto catalyst surface.

POSITIVE — REALIZED STATES:
  A region of reactant molecules is present on the catalyst surface.
  Electron transfer is established.
  Kinetic energy is present in chemical bonds.
  Catalyst atoms are stabilized at active sites.
  Stretched chemical bonds are present.
  Reactant adsorption is established.

TOPIC: How a neuron sends an electrical signal.

EXPLANATION:
The neuron maintains a resting membrane potential. Depolarization opens voltage-gated sodium channels. Sodium ions flow inward, triggering further depolarization. Potassium channels open to repolarize the membrane. Pumps restore ion gradients.

NEGATIVE — INITIAL STATES:
  neuron
  sodium ions
  potassium ions
  electrochemical gradient
  membrane potential
  voltage-gated sodium channels
  voltage-gated potassium channels
  ion pumps
  ion leaks

NEUTRAL — INTERACTIONS:
  Voltage-gated sodium channels open when membrane potential depolarizes.
  Sodium ions diffuse following their electrochemical gradient.
  Potassium ions diffuse following their electrochemical gradient.
  Ion pumps transport sodium outward and potassium inward.
  Sodium leaks through membrane channels.
  Potassium leaks through membrane channels.
  Voltage-gated potassium channels open during depolarization.
  Electrochemical gradients influence membrane potential via ion leaks.

POSITIVE — REALIZED STATES:
  A state of depolarization is established.
  A sodium ion gradient is present.
  A potassium ion gradient is present.
  Ion transport is maintained.
  A sodium leakage condition is present.
  A potassium leakage condition is present.
  A state of repolarization is established.
  Influence of sodium gradients on membrane potential is present.

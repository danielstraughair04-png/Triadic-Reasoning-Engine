===== TRIADIC AGENT v7.0 =====
TOPIC: How a power transformer works.

EXPLANATION:
AC in the primary winding creates a changing magnetic flux in the core. This flux links to the secondary winding and induces EMF. Load current flows when connected.

NEGATIVE — INITIAL STATES:
  alternating current
  primary winding
  ferromagnetic core
  magnetic flux
  secondary winding
  electromotive force
  voltage
  load

NEUTRAL — INTERACTIONS:
  Alternating current generates changing flux.
  Flux links primary and secondary windings.
  Linked flux induces electromotive force.
  Induced EMF generates voltage across secondary terminals.
  Voltage drives current through load.
  AC variations alter flux intensity.
  Core concentrates flux between windings.
  EMF corresponds to flux rate of change.

POSITIVE — REALIZED STATES:
  Changing magnetic flux is established.
  Magnetic flux linkage is present.
  Electromotive force is induced.
  Voltage is present across secondary terminals.
  Current is present when connected to a load.
  Altered magnetic flux intensity is present.
  Concentrated flux is established.
  EMF proportionality to flux change is present.
